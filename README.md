## Authentication with Cookies

For workaround CAPTCHA or accessing private playlists, you can provide a cookies file:

1. **Export cookies** from your browser using a browser extension (like "Get cookies.txt")
2. **Save the file** as `cookies.txt` 
3. **Set the environment variable**: `COOKIES_FILE=/path/to/cookies.txt` (path inside container)
4. **With Docker**: Mount the file into the container (see Docker section below)

**Note**: Keep your cookies file secure and don't share it, as it contains your authentication information.

**See also: [yt-dlp Wiki: Extractors](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Extractors#exporting-youtube-cookies)

## Permissions Required

Your bot needs the following Discord permissions:

## Notes

- The bot will automatically join your voice channel when you use the `/play` command

# Docker Deployment Guide

## Container Registry

The Discord Jukebox bot is automatically built and published to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) when releases are created.

**Image URL:** `ghcr.io/4piu/discord-jukebox`

## Quick Start with Docker

### Option 1: Docker Run
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name discord-jukebox \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here \
  -e PLAYLIST_LIMIT=50 \
  ghcr.io/4piu/discord-jukebox:latest
```

**With cookies file:**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name discord-jukebox \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here \
  -e PLAYLIST_LIMIT=50 \
  -e COOKIES_FILE=/app/cookies.txt \
  -v /path/to/your/cookies.txt:/app/cookies.txt:ro \
  ghcr.io/4piu/discord-jukebox:latest
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose
1. Copy the `docker-compose.yml` file to your deployment directory
2. Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   PLAYLIST_LIMIT=50
   # Optional: For authentication with cookies
   # COOKIES_FILE=/path/to/your/cookies.txt
   ```
3. **If using cookies**: Uncomment and modify the volume mount in `docker-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./temp:/tmp
     - ./cookies.txt:/app/cookies.txt:ro  # Mount your cookies file
   ```
   Then set `COOKIES_FILE=/app/cookies.txt` in your `.env` file
4. Start the container:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Environment Variables

- **Dependencies**: Includes FFmpeg for audio processing
- **Health checks**: Built-in container health monitoring
- **Resource efficient**: Optimized image size with slim Python base

## Updating

To update to the latest version:

```bash
# Using docker compose
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d

# Using docker run
docker stop discord-jukebox
docker rm discord-jukebox
docker pull ghcr.io/4piu/discord-jukebox:latest
# Then run the docker run command again
